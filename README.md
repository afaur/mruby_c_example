This is an example of loading mruby code at runtime that can use c functions as
exposed modules.

Use https://github.com/andlabs/qo to compile or make sure and look at the top of
main.c for required libs when compiling manually.

C Source for the experimental mruby sqlite gem (https://github.com/mattn/mruby-sqlite3)
has been manually added in to this repo to show an example of how mruby gems work.
